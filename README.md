# Mercy.js
WIP bot for Discord.

Author: Ghoulbie

Version: v0.4.0b 07/12/2016

Mercy is a very basic bot currently, but I have hopes that it'll develop into something much more over time.  I'm still getting used to the Discord.io API.  I plan to keep this bot open-source for the duration of this personal project, hopefully it'll be a learning point for others who want to get into it.  I want to keep my project as well documented as possible.  Recently I've been working on adding a lot of specific functionality for my Black Desert Online guild, so a few functions and commands are thrown in there specifically for the structure of that guild, and are not customizable yet to have any use outside of that.

Dependencies for the project can be found in my package.json file.  I'm making a lot of undocumented updates recently because progress and ideas are moving fast and rapidly and I'll have a fully well documented release when I'm ready to release version 1 of the bot.

# Commands

Documentation coming soon.  A lot has changed that I haven't been able to catalogue yet.  these picture commands are getting reckless.
